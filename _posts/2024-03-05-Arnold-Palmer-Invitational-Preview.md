This week (March 7-10) the PGA Tour stops at a much-anticipated destination to kick off the Florida swing, Bay Hill!

With the PGA season shifting gears from the pacific swing onto Florida, fans have been vocal that the leaderboards on PGA Sundays this season have been less star-studded than previous years.  This week being a signature event, the Arnold Palmer Invitational is sure to bring a little more juice to the competitive field and Sunday leaderboard. 69 players have accepted invites to the event, and the top 50 players (including ties) inside the cut will duke it out over the weekend. 

## Bay Hill Breakdown
Bay Hill has consistantly been a tough track on the PGA tournament rotation. Kicking off the Florida swing heres what Bay Hill has to offer the pros: 

- _Length to Par_: 7,466 yards - par 72

- _Skills and Challenges_: Accuracy with irons is at a premium, long rough penalizes wayward drives, nine water hazards are in play, quick bermuda greens, and the venue tends to have gusty/unpredictable winds

- _2023 Scoring Average_: +0.67 strokes to par

- _2023 Winning Score_: -9 Kurt Kitayama

- _Bay Hill Snappy Stat_: In 28 years at Bay Hill, only 7 events ended with a margin of victory greater than two strokes. 4 of those 7 winners was Tiger Woods, and the most recent player to win by more than 2 strokes is Rory Mcllroy.

## Tide Alum in the Field
Two former members of the Tide are in the field this week. OWGR #77 Lee Hodges is teeing it up for the 8th time this season, hoping to turn around his 2024 in Florida. After a breakout win at the 3M open in 2023, the 28 year-old has missed 4 of 7 cuts in 2024. Hes recorded 1 top 25 finish at the Genesis open with a -5 (T24). 

Its no surprise to see Justin Thomas in the field of a signature event, however, JT has only made two appearances at Bay Hill in his career. His two previous starts at the invitational are as follows:

- _2023_: -3 T21
- _2015_: -4 T49

Prior to a mistep at the Genesis (+3 MC), Thomas has come off a rough 2023 season firing. Placing T3 at the American Express, T6 at Pebble, and T12 at a rowdy Waste Management - it looks like a near return to form for the 2022 PGA Champion. 

Lee Hodges is scheduled to tee off Thursday at 9:40 alongside Chris Kirk and JT is to play his first two rounds with newly minted PGA winner Jake Knapp. We will see how the #45 player in the world fares in his first signature event playing alongside Thomas. 

As always, we wish the best for our Alabama veterans and hope to have an exciting, competitve leaderboard by Sunday.

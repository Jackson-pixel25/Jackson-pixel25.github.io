# TPC Sawgrass Delivered The Players Championship Golf Fans Needed

The PGA Tour had a much needed electric week on the golf course at TPC Sawgrass. After a competitive and fun Arnold Palmer Invitational, The Players Championship delivered a riveting event with all the excitement necessary for an instant classic (_shout out NCAA 14 on PS3_). 

With a jam-packed leaderboard all weekend, the unofficial 5th major just gave us all another reason as to why it stands out from the rest. Xander Schauffele and Wyndham Clark ~~got their asses ran down~~ had no answer for Scottie Scheffler who fired a flawless Sunday 64 to win from 5 back. 

## Scheffler Makes History on Sunday
There aren't many feats in golf that haven't been claimed by Tiger Woods in the modern game. However this week, Scottie Scheffler gets to claim a unique title the big cat never could: _Scheffler is the first ever defending champion at The Players Championship._ Before yesterday, no defending champion had finished their next Players appearance at better than -10 (Webb Simpson after his win) or in the top 5. 

If that's not impressive enough for you, how about this: _Scheffler is the first ever golfer to have back-to-back title defenses, with a successfully defended win at Bay Hill and TPC Sawgrass in 2024._

The run that Scheffler has been on is nothing short of incredible, and this is off the "worst putting performances" of his career in 2023 through the early '24 season. With a Sunday 64 that didn't force any playoff ([Sorry Wyndham](https://youtube.com/shorts/JGeW0nAigsE?si=4xiHDZ9aAjSBHqQD)), Scottie gained a total of +7.10(!) strokes on the field total for round 4. Below is a breakdown of Scheffler's round 4 strokes gained, and the strokes gained for the entire event.

_Strokes Gained Round 4:_

| SG PUTT | SG ARG | SG APP | SG OTT | SG T2G | SG TOTAL |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|---------:|
| +0.61   | +0.87  | +2.88  | +2.73  | +6.48  | +7.10    |

_Strokes Gained for the entire tournament:_

| SG PUTT | SG ARG | SG APP | SG OTT | SG T2G | SG TOTAL |
|:--------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|---------:|
| +0.32   | +0.77  | +1.59  | +1.61  | +3.97  | +4.30    |

So what can we learn from this? Well right off the bat, Scheffler didn't putt out of his mind this week at TPC. The leader in SG Putting for the week was Sahith Theegala with a +2.11, _54 spots_ ahead of Scheffler. Even when he needed to make critical putts on Sunday Scheffler still finished 29th in SG Putting for round 4; the leader on Sunday being Matt Fitzpatrick with a +2.90 SG.  

If the putter didn't win Scheffler the tournament, then what did? The number that jumps off the page is his Strokes Gained Tee-to-Green. For those not familiar, SG T2G is the total of all strokes gained minus putting - and Scottie has been _elite_ in this category since breaking out on the PGA Tour. In simpliest terms, Scheffler is so much better at hitting it further in the fairway and sticking it closer to the pin that he only needs to have an _average_ putting week to win. It seems that the old cliche _"Drive for Show, Putt for Dough"_ may not apply to Scheffler. Instead my revision for him goes _"Drive for Show, Putt Maybe Around Average and Dominate the Dough._

## The Tide At TPC
The performance from Tide alum Justin Thomas left something to be desired this week. JT ended his week early with a +1 Missed Cut. After a solid start to the 2024 season, JT's past 3 starts have been less than enjoyable to watch to be frank. I do think he can bounce back in a big way this year, and after a long off-season Thomas had a very positive outlook on where his game was going. Looking toward the start of major season, Thomas has three weeks to get primed for a shot at a Masters victory. Newest Tide tour member Nick Dunlap finished his week up on Friday, finishing at +3 and missing the cut as well. After a shaky made cut at the Arnold Palmer Invitational its safe to say Dunlap is having some growing pains in his transition to the tour - but with a win already under his belt the sky is the limit for the 20 year-old. Lee Hodges has built a nice momentum of made cuts, notching a -6 T-35 after finishing T-12 at Bay Hill. With the past two weeks visiting (maybe) the toughest back-to-back course stretch of the PGA season, Hodges must feel good after missing 4 of his first 7 cuts.

The University of Alabama Men's Golf team had a remarkable showing at the 2024 Linger Longer Invitational, held at the Great Waters Course in Georgia this past March 17th to 19th. They secured their sixth Linger Longer title in program history (tying for the most wins ever at the tournament) and second consecutive win at the event.

The Tide went _LOW_ shooting a combined forty under over three rounds - eleven shots better than second place Virginia. The starting roster rolled out by head coach Jay Seawell was Canon Claycomb, Thomas Ponder, Jonathan Grizz, Jones Free, and JP Cave. The Tide swept the top three spots as Jonathan Grizz took the individual title with 203 strokes, thirteen under par. JP Cave brought home solo second at ten under par, and Canon Claycomb locked in a solo third at nine under. Thomas Ponder finished T22 at two under and Jones Free wrapped it up with a T31 at even par.

This victory extended Alabama's strong season and marks their third team championship, following wins at the Hamptons Intercollegiate and Steelwood Collegiate last fall. Seawell praised his team's resilience and ability to respond to challenges throughout the event. The emergence of Jonathan Griz alongside established performers like Cave and Claycomb highlights the team's depth and potential for continued success throughout the season.

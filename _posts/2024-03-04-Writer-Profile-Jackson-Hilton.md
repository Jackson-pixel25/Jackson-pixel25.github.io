# Hello!
My name is Jackson Hilton, and welcome to my introductory writers blog! Here I hope you can get to know me and my connection to the game of golf a bit better. 

I started out my golfing journey like a lot of younger kids, playing baseball! I had thought baseball was my youth sport until my friends began playing at the neighborhood golf course in our middle school days. That summer walking out on the course around my buddies, with my Maxfli half-set of clubs, I was bit by the golf bug istantly. Later going on to join the 8th grade golf team for my middle school, I was all-in on golf. 

Carrying onto highschool, I had your average junior competitve career. Solid enough to earn a varsity spot on the team I enjoyed my almost four years of high school competition. Our team went on to win the Georgia 7A Highschool State Championship - I had carded a 77-78 solo 18th finish to cap off my junior year. Wanting to defend the championship, the final season ended after 3 events due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside highschool team play, I occassionally played in larger south eastern amatuer events but never made any waves with stellar play.

A fun fact is during this time I was a caddie at  a country club in Sandy Springs, GA for 4 years.

I'm now primed to graduate from the University of Alabama in May of this year, and I could not have had a better time here at the Capstone. This idea spawned with my fellow writer and co-founder RJ. We both were looking for a way to stay connected with Alabama and give back to the game of golf, which led to Tide On Tour. Stay tuned and stick with us as we start this journey!

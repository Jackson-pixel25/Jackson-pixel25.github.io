## Welcome

# Hey Alabama golf fans!

My name is RJ Luddy and I am co-author here at Tide on Tour. I am from Holden, Massachusetts, yes I am a Yankee, and currently a senior at Alabama. I am an avid golf fan, player, and caddie. The game of golf has been a part of my personality for almost half my life now and I want to give something back to the game with these blogs. 

Playing or watching golf is something I always look forward to. Whether it is playing The Links in Tuscaloosa or watching the Barbasol Championship, I am all in. The game is so fun to watch every week with the most athletic, creative, and accurate players in modern history performing week in week out. 

The genesis of this blog formed on a Sunday afternoon when Jackson and I were brainstorming while watching a tournament. We wanted to find out more about our golf team here at the Capstone and also keep track of former Bama players who are now pros. We hope to provide some insight into the Alabama golf world. 

More about me:
I have been a caddie at the Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown, MA for the past seven summers. 
If I am not on the golf course I enjoy sitting on the beach, debating football, and hanging out with friends. I am graduating from Alabama in May and hope to pursue a career in finance.
